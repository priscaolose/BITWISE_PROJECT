# Major Assignment 1 - GitLab and Bitwise Operators

## Introduction
In this assignment, we have implemented a C program that performs various bitwise operations. The program supports operations such as "Count Leading Zeros", "Endian Swap", "Rotate Right", and "Parity". Users can choose an operation from the menu, provide an input integer within the range of 1 to 4294967295 (inclusive), and perform the selected operation using bitwise operators.

## Usage
1. Run the program.
2. Choose an operation from the menu.
3. Enter an integer between 1 and 4294967295 (inclusive).
4. Perform the selected operation using bitwise operators.
5. View the result.
